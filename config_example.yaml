  Analyze the following former-PDF for any private investment opportunities that are still relevant as of {{current_date}}.

  Here's exactly what we're looking for:
  - Private investment opportunities only (Private Equity Raises, Dept Needs, Startup Funding, PIPEs, pre-IPO rounds, convertible notes, bridge rounds, but also M&A)
  - They must still be open, pending, or at least possibly active as of today
  - Skip any public offerings or opportunities that are fully closed
  - Only opportunities raising $1M+ are of interest to us; and if it's real estate, only $15M+ 

  Important:
  - Where possible, extract and include the **specific raise amount** (e.g. "$2.3M", "₹250 crore", "€15M"); **do not use vague terms like “$1M+” unless no exact figure is available**
  - If amount is unclear or not explicitly stated, infer conservatively and flag it as "undisclosed est. >$1M" or similar

  Please return only **one block**, in **under 120 words total**, and inside that block:
  - Summarize each opportunity as a bullet point (1–3 short ones is fine)
  - Make it readable and quick to scan, short phrases - no full sentences

  If there are **no such private investment opportunities**, respond only with:

  X

  If there **is** something relevant, respond in this exact format (and only this format):

  Company: [Name of the company]

  Opportunity:
  - [Short summary of opportunity 1]
  - [Short summary of opportunity 2]
  - ...

  Who to contact: [e.g. "Company directly", "Placement agent mentioned", "No contact listed"]
